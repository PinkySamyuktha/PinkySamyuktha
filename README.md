## 📚 Academic Projects

### 1. Health Data Analytics (SAS)
Analyzed drug efficacy across 3,400 patient records to assess treatment group differences. Used statistical tools in SAS to perform ANOVA and validate results at a 95% confidence level.

### 2. Blood Pressure Analysis (Advanced Python)
Developed a predictive model to examine the relationship between lifestyle habits and blood pressure. Utilized pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn for EDA, regression modeling, and visualization.

### 3. Enhancing Medical QA System (NLP with Python)
Built an AI-powered medical question-answering system using Named Entity Recognition and Naive Bayes Classifier. Applied NLP preprocessing and the MedQuAD dataset to improve QA performance.

### 4. Hospital LOS Comparison (SPSS)
Evaluated whether hospital length of stay differs across three departments. Used descriptive stats, normality tests, Levene’s test, and ANOVA in SPSS to draw significant conclusions.

### 5. Healthcare Management System (SQL)
Created a normalized SQL database to manage patient data, billing, scheduling, and EHR workflows. Focused on relational integrity, data types, constraints, and realistic table interlinking.

### 6. Blood Pressure Analytics (Python)
Performed regression analysis and visualizations to identify patterns between blood pressure and key lifestyle indicators. Used seaborn, matplotlib, and statsmodels for EDA and modeling.

### 7. Splicing Factor Gene Analysis (R)
Conducted exploratory data analysis on splicing factor gene expression in cancer datasets. Used `ggplot2` for visualizations and `randomForest` for classification and pattern recognition.

### 8. Study of Cerecetam on Aphasia in CVA Patients (PharmD Research)
Led a clinical research study to evaluate the effects of Cerecetam on aphasia in stroke patients. Monitored speech recovery, documented outcomes, and supported publication in peer-reviewed journal.
